# ECSE-551-Machine-Learning
This repo consists all codes and reports made as part of the graduate level course at McGill University.

## Mini Project 1: Implementing Logistic Regression Model
We implemented the linear classifier - Logistic Regression - from scratch in Python. The model was trained on two given datasets and goal was to perform accurare binary classification on them both. 
The csv files of datasets, final Python notebook of the code, and PDF report in the format of a [NeurIPS 2020 LaTeX Template](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) have all been added in the repo.

## Mini Project 2: Performance Comparison of Text Classification Algorithms
We investigated the performance of various classifiers on a mutli-class text classification problem. We developed the Bernoulli Naive-Baiyes Algorithm from scratch, and compared its performance with five classifiers from SciKit-Learn package: Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
The train and test files (csv), final Python notebook of the code, and PDF report in the format of a [NeurIPS 2020 LaTeX Template](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) have all been added in the repo.

## Mini Project 3: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
We investigated the performance of two deep convolutional networks: LeNet and ResNet on a 10-class image classification problem. By training the models and evaluating their performance for varying epochs, employing data augmentation, and dropout regularization, we observed that ResNet outperfomed LeNet. Furthermore, ResNet-34 exhibited better performance than ResNet-18. 
Given data (consisting of train and test data in pickle, and train labels in csv), final Python notebook of the code, and PDF report in the format of a [NeurIPS 2020 LaTeX Template](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) have all been added in the repo.
