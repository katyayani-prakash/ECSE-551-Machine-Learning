# ECSE-551-Machine-Learning
This repo consists of codes and reports made as part of the graduate level course at McGill University. Train and test files of datasets (csv and/or pkl), final Python notebooks, and PDF reports in the format of a [NeurIPS 2020 LaTeX Template](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) for each mini project have been added to respective folders.

## Mini Project 1: Implementing Logistic Regression Model
We implemented the linear classifier - Logistic Regression - from scratch in Python. The model was trained on two given datasets and goal was to perform accurare binary classification on them both. 

## Mini Project 2: Performance Comparison of Text Classification Algorithms
We investigated the performance of various classifiers on a mutli-class text classification problem. We developed the Bernoulli Naive-Baiyes Algorithm from scratch, and compared its performance with five classifiers from SciKit-Learn package: Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Also participated in an internal Kaggle competition and achieved **0.94611** test accuracy in final competition.

## Mini Project 3: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
We investigated the performance of two deep convolutional networks: LeNet and ResNet on a 10-class image classification problem. By training the models and evaluating their performance for varying epochs, employing data augmentation, and dropout regularization, we observed that ResNet outperfomed LeNet. Furthermore, ResNet-34 exhibited better performance than ResNet-18. Also participated in an internal Kaggle competition and achieved **0.97614** test accuracy in final competition.
